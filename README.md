SQL.

!!DISCLAMER!!
  Sorry this project is not complete. I am currently behind the class schedule due to other classes and work. These past few days have been devoted to working longer
  manditory shifts (~12 hours each this week). I know what's done is done, but this weekend (9/18 -9/20) will be devoted to catching up on the lectures/reading and 
  completing A1, P1, P2, P3, as well as starting on A2, P4. Thank you for your time and the amount of content you've uploaded to make learning proper Software 
  Development techniques as easy and clear as possible.
